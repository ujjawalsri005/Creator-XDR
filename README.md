# 🔎 Overview

Content creators increasingly depend on digital platforms for their identity, communication, business relationships, and income.

This also makes creator accounts attractive targets for:

* Account impersonation
* Phishing
* Credential theft
* Account takeover
* Suspicious logins
* Unknown devices
* Fake sponsorship messages
* Malicious links
* Identity misuse
* Social engineering

Existing creator verification systems generally focus on proving that an account is authentic, while conventional cybersecurity tools are often designed for organizations rather than individual creators.

**CreatorXDR bridges these two areas.**

It provides a unified platform where a creator can:

1. Verify their identity.
2. Register their original account.
3. Generate a blockchain-backed verification proof.
4. Monitor account-security events.
5. Detect suspicious activity.
6. Analyze potentially malicious URLs.
7. Identify possible impersonation.
8. Receive risk-based alerts.
9. View recommended security actions.
10. Maintain a tamper-evident security/audit history.

---

# ❗ Problem Statement

Creators can face multiple digital-security threats simultaneously.

For example:

```text
Creator
   │
   ├── Fake account impersonating them
   │
   ├── Phishing link sent as a sponsorship offer
   │
   ├── Login from an unknown device
   │
   ├── Multiple failed authentication attempts
   │
   └── Potential credential exposure
```

These events are usually handled separately.

CreatorXDR aims to bring these security signals together and provide the creator with a centralized view of their digital security.

---

# 💡 Proposed Solution

CreatorXDR combines:

```text
Identity Verification
        +
Original Account Registration
        +
Blockchain Verification
        +
Security Monitoring
        +
Threat Detection
        +
Risk Assessment
        +
Actionable Alerts
        +
Audit Trail
```

The result is a creator-focused security platform that provides both **identity credibility** and **cybersecurity monitoring**.

---

# 🎯 Objectives

The primary objectives of CreatorXDR are:

* Establish a verified creator identity.
* Associate the verified identity with an original account.
* Provide tamper-evident verification through blockchain.
* Detect suspicious login behavior.
* Monitor unknown devices.
* Identify potential phishing URLs.
* Detect possible impersonation.
* Calculate security risk based on multiple indicators.
* Generate actionable security alerts.
* Maintain a security event history.
* Protect sensitive identity information.
* Provide a centralized creator-security dashboard.

---

# ✨ Key Features

## 1. Creator Identity Verification

Allows a creator to establish a verified identity within CreatorXDR.

The prototype separates identity verification from blockchain storage.

Sensitive identity information is **not stored directly on the blockchain**.

---

## 2. Original Account Registration

A verified creator can register their original social-media account.

Example:

```text
Creator
   │
   └── Verified Identity
            │
            └── Original Account
                    │
                    └── CreatorXDR Profile
```

---

## 3. Blockchain Verification

A cryptographic verification credential/hash can be recorded on a blockchain.

The blockchain provides:

* Integrity
* Timestamping
* Verification proof
* Tamper resistance
* Auditability

---

## 4. Login Monitoring

CreatorXDR can analyze login events using indicators such as:

* Device
* Location indicator
* Login time
* Failed authentication attempts
* Known/unknown device status

---

## 5. Device Monitoring

The system maintains information about devices associated with the creator.

Example:

```text
Laptop       → Known
Phone        → Known
New Device   → Unknown
```

An unknown device can contribute to the overall risk assessment.

---

## 6. Phishing Detection

CreatorXDR can analyze URLs and identify potentially suspicious links.

Possible indicators include:

* Suspicious domain
* URL structure
* Login-related keywords
* Domain reputation
* Known malicious indicators
* Model-based classification

Example:

```text
URL
 ↓
Feature Extraction
 ↓
Threat Analysis
 ↓
Risk Level
 ↓
CreatorXDR Alert
```

---

## 7. Impersonation Detection

The platform can identify accounts that may be attempting to impersonate a verified creator.

Potential signals include:

* Username similarity
* Display-name similarity
* Profile information
* Profile-image similarity
* Other creator-identifying information

The result can be classified as:

```text
LOW
MEDIUM
HIGH
```

This classification is an indicator for investigation rather than definitive proof of malicious intent.

---

## 8. Threat Detection Engine

The threat engine combines multiple security indicators.

```text
Login Anomaly
      +
Unknown Device
      +
Phishing Indicator
      +
Impersonation Indicator
      +
Credential Indicator
      ↓
Threat Engine
      ↓
Risk Assessment
```

---

## 9. Risk Scoring

CreatorXDR can assign a risk score based on detected indicators.

Example prototype model:

```text
New Device              +25
Unusual Location        +25
Multiple Failed Logins  +30
Suspicious URL          +40
High Impersonation      +50
```

The resulting score can be mapped to a risk category:

```text
0–29      LOW
30–59     MEDIUM
60–100    HIGH
```

These values are configurable prototype parameters and are not intended as a universal cybersecurity standard.

---

## 10. Security Alerts

When suspicious activity is detected, CreatorXDR generates an alert.

Example:

```text
HIGH-RISK EVENT

Suspicious login detected.

Indicators:
• Unknown device
• Unusual login location
• Multiple failed attempts

Recommended actions:
• Review active sessions
• Revoke unknown device
• Change credentials if necessary
• Enable MFA
```

---

## 11. Recommended Actions

CreatorXDR is designed to provide actionable information instead of simply reporting an event.

Possible actions include:

* Review login
* Review active sessions
* Revoke unknown device
* Change password
* Enable MFA
* Avoid suspicious URLs
* Report potential impersonation
* Review account activity

---

## 12. Security Audit Trail

Security events can be recorded with:

* Event ID
* Creator ID
* Event type
* Timestamp
* Risk level
* Event hash
* Blockchain reference

This provides a tamper-evident history for relevant security events.

---

# 🧠 Threat Detection Model

CreatorXDR initially uses a **rule-based risk engine**.

Example:

```python
risk_score = 0

if new_device:
    risk_score += 25

if unusual_location:
    risk_score += 25

if failed_attempts >= 5:
    risk_score += 30

if suspicious_url:
    risk_score += 40

if high_impersonation_similarity:
    risk_score += 50
```

Risk classification:

```python
if risk_score >= 60:
    severity = "HIGH"
elif risk_score >= 30:
    severity = "MEDIUM"
else:
    severity = "LOW"
```

This architecture allows a machine-learning model to replace or supplement individual detection components later.

---

# 🔗 Blockchain Design

CreatorXDR does **not** store sensitive identity information directly on the blockchain.

Instead:

```text
Identity Verification
        ↓
Verification Result
        ↓
Credential / Hash
        ↓
Smart Contract
        ↓
Blockchain
```

Possible blockchain record:

```text
creatorHash
verificationHash
timestamp
transactionId
```

The application database can store the transaction reference needed to verify the proof.

---

# 🔐 Security & Privacy

CreatorXDR follows these principles:

### Sensitive data

Sensitive identity information should remain off-chain.

### Password security

Passwords must never be stored in plaintext.

Use:

* Password hashing
* Secure authentication
* Session/token security

### Blockchain

Blockchain should be used for:

* Proof
* Integrity
* Timestamping
* Auditability

It should not replace the application's normal database.

### Secrets

API keys, database credentials and blockchain private keys must never be committed to Git.

Use environment variables:

```text
.env
```

and provide:

```text
.env.example
```

instead.

---

# ⚙️ Installation

## 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/CreatorXDR.git

# 🤝 Contribution Guidelines

Each team member should work on a separate branch.

Example:

```text
main
│
├── feature/frontend
├── feature/backend
├── feature/blockchain
├── feature/threat-engine
├── feature/phishing
└── feature/testing
```

## Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>

git add .

git commit -m "Add <feature>"

git push origin feature/<feature-name>
```

Create a Pull Request into `main`.

Do not directly push experimental changes to `main`.

---

# 📋 Commit Convention

Use descriptive commits.

Examples:

```text
feat: add creator registration API
feat: implement phishing URL analyzer
feat: add blockchain identity contract
feat: create security dashboard

fix: correct login risk calculation
fix: resolve alert API issue

docs: update architecture documentation

```

---

# 🌿 Branch Strategy

```text
main
  │
  ├── develop
  │
  ├── feature/frontend
  ├── feature/backend
  ├── feature/blockchain
  ├── feature/threat-engine
  ├── feature/phishing
  └── feature/testing
```

`main` should contain stable versions.

Feature branches should be merged only after testing/review.
